# karty - a poker rule engine
---------------------
A library capable of analyzing and evaluating poker hand strengts. 
Can be used to build digital poker rooms, bots, and simulated poker 
tournaments

# Origins
---------------------
Many, many years ago (around 2005/06 ?) I was ill for an extended 
period of time, bound to bed, with not much to do. It was during 
that time that I found a simple implementation of a poker engine 
in C#, which inspired me to play around with the concept of poker AI 
in Java. So I ported some of that C# code, and improved it to make it somewhat 
usable. After recovering, I totally forgot about this project. Several 
years later I found it on one of my dusty hard drives, and out of the pure 
nostalgia for the memories of that sick period decided to revive it. 
I Mavenized it, cleaned up few issues and uploaded to github. Maybe will get back 
to it after all these years and expand it.

# Dislaimer
---------------------
In its current form, the code kind of sucks (although if I remember 
correctly it does generate correct outputs). I don't write code like 
this anymore, it's a code written by me way back when Maven was just 
in incubator stage, and GIT was barely released. Nonetheless, a good 
look into my past :-)
