# karty - a poker rule engine
---------------------
A library capable of analyzing and evaluating poker hand strengts. 
Can be used to build digital poker rooms, bots, and simulated poker 
tournaments

# Origins
---------------------
Many, many years ago (around 2005/06 ?) I was ill for an extended 
period of time, bound to bed with nothing much to do. It was during 
that time found simple implementation of poker engine in C#, which 
inspired me to play with the concept of poker AI in Java. I ported 
some of that C# code, and improved it to make it somewhat playable. 
After recovering, I totally forgot about this project. Recently, 
found it on one of my dusty hard drives and out of pure nostalgia 
reviewed it, Mavenized it and uploaded to github. Maybe will get back 
to it after all these years and clean it, improve it and make it 
actually into a useful library.

# Dislaimer
---------------------
In its current form, the code kind of sucks (although if I remember 
correctly it does generate correct outputs). I don't write code like 
this anymore, it's a code written by me way back when Maven was just 
in incubator stage, and GIT was barely released. Nonetheless, a good 
look into my past :-)
